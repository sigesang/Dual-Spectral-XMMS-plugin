Dual Spectralizer - Dual Spectral Analyzer plugin for XMMS
by Joakim Elofsson 2000

REQUIERMENTS:
	working XMMS 1.2.x <http://www.xmms.org>
	(X, gtk+, pthreads... etc)

BUILD:
	included binary was build on a linux-i686-glibc2.1.3 system
	
	to build, do:
	make

	if you want you may change OPT in Makefile etc.

INSTALL:
	try  make install  as root (or  su -c 'make install')

	will install plugin in xmms plugindirs and themes in
	themedir (in xmms datadir)
	
	(if you have no root access, it's probably possible installing this
	in your ~/.xmms dir, if so.. you must edit XMMS_DATADIR &
	INSTALL-DIR in Makefile, and recompile)

USE:
	activate it in XMMS Vis-plugin-config
	messaround with plugin-config.. and enjoy
	(nice config:
	  use Avegaring (ex. Step up/decay and avegaring factor 0.85
	     logaritmic ampiltude scale with 137db range
	     gain 3db/octave		        
	)
 skins
	are 277x68 sized xpm the first 275 columns is the background
	and the last one are barcolor

 included skins (made by me)
  bg_xmms.xpm   - the one in the .so, made to look like default xmms-skin
  bg_blue.xpm  - made to look nice with blue_led -skin
  bg_white.xpm - made to look nice with amptech -skin (by $teven)
  bg_gtk.xpm - made to look nice with GTK+ -skin (by James M. Cape)

possibel TODOs (not planned)
  * autoconf -stuff (Remi Cohen-Scali have made this, not integraded yet)
  ...


A thanks to Remi Cohen-Scali for some ideas & code.
